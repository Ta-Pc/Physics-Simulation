A 2D physics engine built from scratch in C++ and SFML to simulate various physical phenomena. This project was developed to deepen my understanding of object-oriented programming in C++ and to apply core mathematical and physics principles to a functional software application.

### üöÄ Features

The simulation currently models the following physical concepts:

| Feature                            | Description                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ü™ê **Gravity & Mass**              | Objects are affected by a constant gravitational force, and their mass influences interactions.         |
| üí• **Elastic Collisions**          | Implements collision detection and response between objects, conserving momentum and kinetic energy.      |
| üåÄ **Uniform Circular Motion**     | Demonstrates objects moving in a circular path at a constant speed.                                     |
| üéØ **Vertical Projectile Motion**  | Models the trajectory of objects launched vertically under the influence of gravity.                    |
| üî© **Spring Forces (Hooke's Law)** | Simulates the force exerted by a spring, causing objects to oscillate.                                  |
| üß± **Boundary Constraints**        | Objects correctly collide with and rebound from the window boundaries.                                  |

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

| Component                | Technologies Used                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Core Language**        | `C++` (utilizing modern C++ standards and OOP principles)                          |
| **Graphics & Windowing** | `SFML` (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for rendering shapes and managing the window. |
| **Build System**         | `CMake` for cross-platform project building and dependency management.             |

### ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To compile and run this project, you will need a C++ compiler (like g++, Clang, or MSVC), CMake, and the SFML library installed on your system.

  <summary><strong>Build & Run Instructions</strong></summary>

  1.  **Prerequisites:**
      *   A modern C++ compiler.
      *   [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (version 3.10 or higher).
      *   [SFML Development Libraries](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php) (ensure the version matches your compiler).
  
  2.  **Clone the repository:**
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/Ta-Pc/Physics-Simulation.git
      cd Physics-Simulation
      ```

  3.  **Configure the project with CMake:**
      *   Create a `build` directory (this is best practice and is ignored by Git).
      ```bash
      mkdir build
      cd build
      ```
      *   Run CMake to generate the build files. You may need to tell CMake where to find SFML by setting the `SFML_DIR` variable.
      ```bash
      # Replace "path/to/your/sfml" with the actual path to the SFML library on your system
      cmake -D SFML_DIR=path/to/your/sfml/lib/cmake/SFML ..
      ```
  
  4.  **Compile the project:**
      *   Use the build tool generated by CMake.
      ```bash
      cmake --build .
      ```
      *   **For Visual Studio Users:** The previous step will generate a `.sln` file in the `build` directory. Open this solution file in Visual Studio and build the project from there (usually by pressing `F7` or `Ctrl+Shift+B`).

  5.  **Run the simulation:**
      *   The executable will be located in the `build` directory (or a subdirectory like `build/Debug` on Windows).
      ```bash
      # On Linux/macOS
      ./Physics-Simulation
      
      # On Windows (from the build/Debug directory)
      Physics-Simulation.exe
      ```

### üå± Future Enhancements
*   Implementing more complex physics like rotational dynamics and friction.
*   Adding user interactivity to spawn or "throw" objects with the mouse.
*   Developing a more robust collision system (e.g., separating axis theorem).
